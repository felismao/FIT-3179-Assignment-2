        <p>There are more than 500 active volcanoes in the world. More than half of those volcanoes are part of the "Ring of Fire," a region that encircles the Pacific Ocean.
            Countries that are located in the ring of fire includes: Australia, New Zealand, Mexico, Peru, Chile, Guam, Taiwan, Philippines, Indonesia and Hawaii. 
           <strong> Volcanic Explosivity Index (VEI)</strong> is a scale that describes the size of explosive volcanic eruptions base on magnitude, intensity, duration, and the plume. 
           The scale is logarithmic from VEI 2 and up, meaning an increase of 1 index indicates an eruption that is 10 times as powerful.
             The most deadliest eruption is Mt Tambora in 1815, Indonesia. It has a VEI of 7.

                    <p><strong>Stratovolcanoes</strong> have the highest number of volcanic activities. Stratovolcanoes have relatively steep sides and are cone-shaped. 
                        The lava produced by the stratovolcano does not flow that easily, hence it builds up around the vent forming the steep sides. 
                        Stratovolcanoes are also one of the most dangerous volcanoes as they are more likely to produce explosive eruptions due to gas building up in the viscous magma.

                        Mt. Pelee, a volcano at the northern end of Martinique, is one example of a stratovolcano. On May 8th, 1902 it erupts, causing over 28,000 deaths and destroyed the city of St. Pierre.
                        This is the largest number of casualties for a volcanic eruption in this century.

            The chart above shows the number of volcanic activity from the year 1970 - 2020.  
            The year 2018 has the most volcanic activity throughout 50 years. 
            In 2018, the Kilauea volcano erupted changes the island of Hawai'i forever. 
            From May through August, large lava flows covered land southeast of the park destroying over 700 homes.
            At the same time, the summit area of the park was dramatically changed by many earthquake, towering ash plumes, and massive collapse of Kilauea caldera.
